Special thanks to eternity for the help getting the 64-bit port finished. Can't thank you enough.

The Skyrim Script Extender VR, or SKSEVR for short, is a modder's resource that expands the scripting capabilities of Skyrim VR. It does so without modifying the executable files on disk, so there are no permanent side effects.

Compatibility:

SKSEVR will support the latest version of Skyrim VR available on Steam, and _only_ this version (currently 1.4.15 with any combination of numbers after that). Due to low free time on my part, it may take longer than normal for updates to be released after patches come out. Please use sensible backup policies. Yes, I know that a patch has been released. Emailing me will not make the update show up more quickly.

[ Installation ]

1. Copy the .dll and .exe files to your Skyrim VR directory. This is usually in your Program Files folder under Steam\SteamApps\common\SkyrimVR\. If you see a file named SkyrimVR, this is the correct folder. Do not copy these files to the Data folder as with a normal mod. The "src" folder is only useful for programmers, most users can ignore it.

2. Copy the .pex files in Data\Scripts\ into the Data\Scripts\ folder of your installation. The .pex files are needed by all users of SKSE. 

3. If you create mods, copy the .psc files in Data\Scripts\Source\ into the Data\Scripts\Source\ folder of your installation. The .psc files are only needed if you have the CreationKit installed and intend to create or compile Papyrus scripts. Make sure to add them to your include path.

4. Run sksevr_loader.exe to launch the game.

[ Suggestions for Modders ]

If your mod requires SKSEVR, please provide a link to the main SKSE website <http://skse.silverlock.org/> instead of packaging it with your mod install. Future versions of SKSEVR will be backwards compatibile, so including a potentially old version can cause confusion and/or break other mods which require newer versions.

[ Troubleshooting / FAQ ]

* Crashes after a patch is released, usually early in the startup process
 - Delete the files in Data\SKSE\Plugins and try again.

* Crashes or strange behavior:
 - Let us know how you made it crash, and we'll look into fixing it.

* XBone or PS4 version?
 - No. We do things that can't be done on consoles due to restrictions put in place by the manufacturers.

* My virus scanner complains about sksevr_loader!
 - It is not a virus. To extend Skyrim and the editor, we use a technique called DLL injection to load our code. Since this technique can also be used by viruses, some badly-written virus scanners assume that any program doing it is a virus. Adding an exception to your scanner's rules may be necessary.

* I've followed the directions, but Skyrim VR still seems to launch without SKSEVR!
- Try running sksevr_loader.exe as an Administrator by right-clicking on sksevr_loader.exe and selecting "Run As Administrator". This can be enabled as a compatibility option in the program's properties window. Note that this may run the game as a separate user, so your load order will need to be copied to the new user's profile.
 
* Can I modify and release my own version of SKSE based on the included source code?
 - No; the suggested method for extending SKSE is to write a plugin. If this does not meet your needs, please email the contact addresses listed below.

* How do I write Papyrus scripts using SKSE extensions?
 - If you've properly installed the .psc files from Data\Scripts\Source you can simply use the new functions listed.
 
* How do I know what SKSE functions have been added?
 - Look at the included .psc files in Data\Scripts\Source\. At the bottom of each .psc file is a label that shows the SKSE functions which have been added. Most have comments describing their purpose, if it is not obvious from the name.

* How do I write a plugin for SKSE?
 - See PluginAPI.h for instructions, as well as the example plugin project included with the rest of the source code.

* Can I include SKSE as part of a mod pack/collection or otherwise rehost the files?
 - No. Providing a link to http://skse.silverlock.org/ is the suggested method of distribution. Exceptions may be given under applicable circumstances; contact us at the email addresses below. This means that if you see this file available for download anywhere other than http://skse.silverlock.org, that service is violating copyright. I don't like having to explicitly spell this out, but my hand has been forced.

* Do I need to keep old SKSE DLLs around for backwards compatibility?
 - No, they are only needed if you want to run old versions of the runtime with the last version of SKSE released for that version. Feel free to delete any skse_*.dll files that are not included with the main archive.

* Where did the log files go?
 - To support users on machines that don't have write access to the Program Files folder, they have been moved to the <My Documents>\My Games\Skyrim VR\SKSE\ folder.

* Where is the skse.ini file?
 - SKSE does not include one by default. Create an empty text file in <skyrim root>\Data\SKSE\ named skse.ini. Create the SKSE folder if it doesn't already exist.

* How do I uninstall SKSEVR?
 - Delete the .dll and .exe files starting with sksevr_ from your Skyrim folder.

[ Contact the SKSE Team ]

Before contacting us, make sure that your game launches properly without SKSE64 first. If SKSE64 doesn't appear to be working, follow the steps in the FAQ first, then send us skse64.log, skse64_loader.log, and skse64_steam_loader.log as attachments. These files may be found in <My Documents>\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\.

### MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR LOG FILES AS ATTACHMENTS ###
We cannot help you solve load order problems. Yes, I know when a patch comes out. Do not email when a new version of the game is released.
